ERCP x9 voron 2.4. 350mm top mount

This mod will allow you to place 9 ERCP's with ERCF itself on top of your voron 2.4 350mm

BOM: 8x 2020 extrusions 500-510mm length (I use 500mm)

printed parts:

mount_right and mount_left - start with this parts, first mount 2 2020 extrusions to this parts, then mount the assembley in front of the printer (see image below, left side shown). This first two extrusions are for ERCF.

Next pick two mount_2nd_floor_2x and premount two exrusions again, then mount this assembley on top of previous

Next pick two pairs of mount_ercp_left_2x and mount_ercp_right_2x and premount two extrusions on each pair

The first pair mount to printer in touch with already mounted bracket, the second one with distance 135mm+ (135mm is min distance that allows normal operation of most standard 1kg spools, increasing this distance takes place behind the printer).

At this point you can mount your ERCF and ERCP's to extrusions and route filament tubes from ERCP's to ERCF

Since ERCP is not super stiff you wil need to mount support_9x to each ERCP to avoid spool holder sagging (see first image)
And the last one, since original spool holder are not round and mounted at an angle, it can happen, that spool swings but not rotate, that makes hard for extruder to wind up filament. The solution is simple adding spool_round_9x to every spool holder. Just slide it on and secure with two M3x18 screws (I'm screwing trough plastik, you can ugrade it with heat insert if you want)

With this mod I dont use the stock filament inlet in the back of printer, this makes reverse boden tube too lond. I drilled a hole in a top panel and pass my boden tube trough it.

A word about routing reverce boden tube between ERCF and extruder. Dont try to hide this tube under ERCF, due to small curve radius this will make impossible for extruder to wind up your filament.
